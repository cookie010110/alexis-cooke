        <h1>Love them!</h1>
        <p>Lizards are cheaper than most domesticated animals, as their food is small and cheap, they do not require much space (depending) and can't bite. As a dog owner it can get to be demanding to take my dog for hour long runs to get her energy out when I have school to do. Lizards can be extraordinary pets as they are low maintenance, and won't have to wake up in the middle of the night to let it outside to pee! They are good companions even if they are not as interested in play.</p>
   
        <h1>They are boring</h1>
        <p>Lizards don't do much. I like to be able to communicate with my pets, even if it's just being able to lay in bed with them. Most lizards are too small to be able to give an abundace of physical affection. It is a lot more difficult to bring a reptile on fun adventures than a dog. Having a lizard would be difficult to travel with as they have a lot more care and accessories to bring with.</p>
